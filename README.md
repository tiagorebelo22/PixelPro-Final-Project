### *A deep learning application to enhance your pictures*

PixelPro is a Web App that brings advanced image resolution enhancement to the fingertips of its users. It was developed as my Final Project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack, encompassing the following key steps:

1\. Super resolution model and dataset selection\
For this project, I chose the Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network (EDSR) model described by Lim et al. (2017). To train and validate the models, I used the DIV2K dataset (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/).

2\. Model training\
Using Tensorflow, I developed three Deep Learning models that increase image resolution by factors of x2, x4, or x8.

3\. Web App development\
Using Visual Studio Code and Streamlit, I created a user-friendly Web App for PixelPro. Users can upload low resolution images and generate high resolution versions with scaling factors of x2, x4, x8, or all. The Picture Gallery feature allows users to compare the original and generated images side by side, and download the enhanced images.

PixelPro simplifies the process of generating high resolution images from low resolution sources, providing users with an accessible tool to enhance their visual content.
